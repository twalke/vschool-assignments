Loops help you reduce your lines of code when performing a task multiple times. Here you will learn how to use some of the different looping structures. Beware of infinite loops!

- Write a function that accepts a string as input. Write a loop to print out each letter of that string individually.

- Write a function that accepts a string and a single character as inputs. Write a loop that iterates over the string, and prints the position of the first occurrence of the specified character. If the character is not found, tell that to the user.

- Write a function that accepts an array of numbers as a parameter. Quit the function when the number 42 is found. Let the user know if 42 is not found.

- Write a function that accepts 10 numbers in an array and then prints out the smallest number out of the ten without using Math.min()
