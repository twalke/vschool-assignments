Write a function that generates a random password.

* The function should have a parameter that dictates the length of the password.
* The function may contain any upper and lower case characters.
* The function may contain any numbers and symbols.

#### Example
```js
function randomPasswordGenerator(number) {
    //creates a password
    //number specifies length
}
randomPasswordGenerator(5)
//Returns a password with the length of 5
//Example: s*3Lj
```

#### Extra credit
* The password should have an additional parameter that accepts a string as an argument, whose characters are all found within the generated password.
