Find the frequency of all characters in a given word or phrase, and print them to the console.

* Contain the characters and their counts within an object.
* Each character will be its own key
* Each value will be the character's frequency.

Example:
```js
const phrase = 'slimy smelly solution';

arrayIndex = (str) => {
// Manipulation of str to create an object
}

console.log(arrayIndex(phrase));

//Output: { s: 3, l: 4, i: 2, m: 2, y: 2, ' ': 2, e: 1, o: 2, u: 1, t: 1, n: 1 }

```

#### Hint
Completing this will require the use of object square bracket notation, which you can learn more about from the [MDN page on Working With Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Objects_and_properties)

#### Extra Credit
* Output the original string with all duplicate characters removed (i.e. "slimy eoutn").
* Output the same object, sorted by frequency.
